# OBS Viewer Queue
Allows stream viewers to enter a queue, where there names will then be displayed on screen. This programme was made for Smash Bros so there is also a counter that you can increment for each game that they play. It can also be used with streambots/programmes like "Mix It Up", to automatically cycle the queue and send messages in chat
